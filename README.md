# Techo 


## High-Fidelity Prototyping

### Task 1

Robert is an undergraduate student at Northwestern. He wants to have a burger for dinner tonight but he doesnâ€™t have any ingredients at home. Before his shopping trip, Robert wants to make sure that he is making environmentally conscious decisions when purchasing the ingredients. So he turns to our app for help. 

For this task we implemented a **Home Page**, where users can select which component they want to navigate to easily after launching the app. Without having to open the sidebar, the users can quickly choose which component of the app they want to access. The home page will have four buttons: search, my points, my shopping list, and my daily trivia. Clicking each button will navigate the users to the corresponding components.
